## Hubris: The open source relational database 

Hubris was designed as a drop-in replacement of MySQL(R) with more
features, new storage engines, fewer bugs, and better performance.

Hubris is brought to you by the Hubris Foundation and the Hubris Corporation.
Please read the CREDITS file for details about the Hubris Foundation,
and who is developing Hubris.

Hubris is developed by many of the original developers of MySQL who
now work for the Hubris Corporation, the Hubris Foundation and by
many people in the community.

MySQL, which is the base of Hubris, is a product and trademark of Oracle
Corporation, Inc. For a list of developers and other contributors,
see the Credits appendix.  You can also run 'SHOW authors' to get a
list of active contributors.

A description of the Hubris project and a manual can be found.

Help
-----

More help is available from the Maria Discuss mailing list.

Live QA for beginner contributors
----
Hubris has a dedicated time each week when we answer new contributor questions live on Zulip.
From 8:00 to 10:00 UTC on Mondays, and 10:00 to 12:00 UTC on Thursdays,
anyone can ask any questions theyâ€™d like, and a live developer will be available to assist.

New contributors can ask questions any time, but we will provide immediate feedback during that interval.
