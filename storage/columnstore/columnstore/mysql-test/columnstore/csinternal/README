[Test Data]

Some of the test cases in this test suite require the available DBT3 and SSD data sets.
These data sets are not included in the test suite and must be available locally.
The follow is the expected path to the data sets

/data/qa/source/dbt3/1m
/data/qa/source/dbt3/1g
/data/qa/source/dbt3/10g
/data/qa/source/dbt3/100g

/data/qa/source/ssd/1m
/data/qa/source/ssd/1g

One ease way of making this data sets available is to store them on a
mountable storage device.  If you are using a virtual machine environment, such as
virtualBox, you can store the data on the host server.  That way, the server under test
or VMs can simply mount the data according uisng the paths above.
