Note, this used to be a seperate repo (SM).  To merge it into the ColumnStore
repo (CS), all of the files in SM were moved to the dir we want them in after 
they are merged into the CS repo, using 'git mv'.

'git mv' sort of nukes and sort of preserves history.  'git log' by default
does not follow history past renames.  'git log --follow' does, but
only for single files.  If for some reason you need the history of a file,
use 'git log --follow'.  If you need the history of a wider scope,
look at the original SM repo at http://github.com/pleblanc1976/storage-manager.
